# kooksa.codes aka portfolio
Hi, I am Alexandra Kuksa, a front-end developer &#128075;
 This portfolio features some of the latest projects I've implemented. Main branch contains source code and "gh-pages" branch contains static pages generated by Eleventy. Live version is available at [kooksa.codes](https://kooksa.codes).

### Why website, not just a bunch of links in CV?
I crafted this website mostly to try some modern technologies that I've never used in my workflow before. As a result, I got a nice experience with Eleventy (static site generator), Vanilla JS (bye-bye JQuery &#129396;), fancy variable fonts, images processing, GSAP transitions, i18n, deploying to GitHub Pages and much more. I even learnt one cool flexbox hack! CSS is endlessly amazing.

### What's next?
Currently I am taking a JavaScript Fundamentals online course on Stepik to improve my skills. I am also planning to get familiar with React after that (yes, yet another course &#129299;).

### Let's collaborate
I am looking for a full-time job (remote / office / relocation). I have both front-end developer and UI/UX designer skills and experience, but I'd like to focus on the code. Since design is still important for me, I'll do my best to provide the most accurate implementation with the attention to details. Feel free to contact me if you think we're a match &#128521;
